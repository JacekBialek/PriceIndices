## Package update 

## Improvements: 
* New references to some of multilateral methods have been added (e.g. GEKS-AGI, GEKS-AQU methods)

## Downstream dependencies

I have also run R CMD check on downstream dependencies of httr

All packages that I could install passed.

## I run the following instruction successfully:

* devtools::check() -> 0 errors √ | 0 warnings √ | 0 notes √
