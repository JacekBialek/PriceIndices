\title{Extending the multilateral weighted GEKS-AQI price index by using window splicing methods.}
\usage{
wgeksaqi_splice(
  data,
  start,
  end,
  window = 13,
  splice = "movement",
  interval = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{The user's data frame with information about sold products. It must contain columns: \code{time} (as Date in format: year-month-day,e.g. '2020-12-01'), \code{prices} (as positive numeric), \code{quantities}  (as positive numeric) and \code{prodID} (as numeric, factor or character).}

\item{start}{The base period (as character) limited to the year and month, e.g. "2019-12".}

\item{end}{The research period (as character) limited to the year and month, e.g. "2020-04".}

\item{window}{The length of the time window (as positive integer: typically multilateral methods are based on the 13-month time window).}

\item{splice}{A character string indicating the splicing method. Available options are: "movement", "window","half","mean", "window_published","half_published","mean_published".}

\item{interval}{A logical value indicating whether the function is to provide the price index comparing the research period defined by \code{end} to the base period defined by \code{start} (then \code{interval} is set to FALSE) or all fixed base multilateral indices are to be presented (the fixed base month is defined by \code{start}).}
}
\value{
This function returns a value or values (depending on \code{interval} parameter) of the multilateral weighted GEKS-AQI price index (the weighted GEKS index based on the asynchronous quality adjusted price index formula) extended by using window splicing methods. Available splicing methods are: movement splice, window splice, half splice, mean splice and their additional variants: window splice on published indices (WISP), half splice on published indices (HASP) and mean splice on published indices (see \code{References}). The time window starts in \code{start} and should consist of at least two months. To get information about both price index values and corresponding dates, please see functions: \code{\link{price_indices}} or \code{\link{final_index}}. The function does not take into account aggregating over outlets or product subgroups (to consider these types of aggregating, please use the \code{\link{final_index}} function).
